PMRMP: A Process Model Registration and Management Platform

What is PMRMP?

PMRMP is a business process model registration and management platform. Before PMRMP is immigrated from TaoBao code (http://code.taobao.org), it was also named as BPEP (Business Process Extension Platform).

To facilitate business collaboration and interopration among enterprises, it is critical to discover and reuse appropriate business processes modeled in different languages and stored in different repositories. However, the formats of business process models are very different, which makes it a challenge to fuse them in a unified way without chaning their orignial representations and semantics. To solve this problem, PMRMP uses semantic interoperability technique which is able to tranform heterogonous process models into the uniform registered items.
